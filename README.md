# SIMPLE CALCULATOR Python project 
# The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator. 
# The program then performs the arithmetic operation on those two numbers based on the user input and then prints the result. 
# If an invalid operator i.e., operator other than "+", "-", "*", or "/" is added, then it prints an error message. 

 
# Here's an example of how to use the program: 
# Enter the first number: 5
# Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): *
# Enter the second number: 3
# Result: 15.0 (output)
